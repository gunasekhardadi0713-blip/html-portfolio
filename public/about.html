<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a first-year undergraduate student at IIIT Pune, driven by a strong interest in engineering and technology. From an early stage, I have maintained a focused and disciplined approach toward academics, aiming to build a solid foundation in science and mathematics.</p>

<p>My academic performance reflects this consistency. I secured 477 out of 500 in my Class 10 board examination and 451 out of 500 in my Class 12 board examination. In addition, I achieved a 97.7 percentile in JEE Main and successfully qualified for JEE Advanced, which highlights my conceptual clarity, analytical thinking, and problem-solving abilities at a national competitive level.</p>

<p>Currently, as a student at IIIT Pune, I am focused on strengthening my technical skills and applying theoretical knowledge to practical challenges. I am motivated to learn continuously, explore emerging technologies, and develop into a competent and responsible engineer who can contribute meaningfully to the field.</p>
